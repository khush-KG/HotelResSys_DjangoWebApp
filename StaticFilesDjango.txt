A. local project
1. create a static folder in your app directory (contains views.py)
2. in your settings.py:
STATIC_URL = 'static/'

""" Note: Your project will probably also have static assets that arenâ€™t tied to a particular app. In addition to using a static/ directory inside your apps, you can define a list of directories (STATICFILES_DIRS) in your settings file where Django will also look for static files. For example: ""

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / "static",
]
STATIC_ROOT = "Bookings/static/"
3. Modify the template 
	i) start with {% load static %}
	ii) change links to : <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'myfirst.css' %}">

4.
